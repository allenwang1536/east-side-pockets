              Since 1997, East Side Pockets has been a fixture in the heart of Providence's busy Thayer Street. We serve
              consistently great Middle Eastern food in a spotless and casual environment seven days a week from 10am to
              late night Monday through Saturday, and until 10pm on Sunday.
            </p>
            <p>
              Falafel (absolutely the best around!), gyros, wraps, baklava, grape leaves, salads, hummus, and tzatziki,
              are available along with all items on our menu for take-out or sit-down dining. Lines move quickly at the
              lunch and dinner hours, and the portions and quality are well worth the short wait.
